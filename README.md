# QC
Quick Commands is a settings manager that emulates settings management syntaxes used in some legacy MUD-clients like JMC. It's meant to be an aid/complement to the GUI in mudlet for getting the basics (aliases, variables, keybindings etc) up and running quickly.

Features:

- Create settings: Aliases, Actions(Triggers), Key bindings, Substitutions, Variables
- Quickcapture groups (%0-9) for complex Aliases, Triggers and Substitutions
- Use Variable references with $-sign ($variable) seamlessly when executing commands or directly from the command line
- Supports creating settings with multiple commands with the default command delimiter
- Mouse support for navigating help files or quickly editing settings (click the content of left or right brackets)
- Profile management and ability to export/import settings
- Automaticly saves your profile (when opening/closing Mudlet, upon reconnect and every 10 minutes)
- Ability to customize what messages are shown
- Customizeable color schemes with adaptive color gradients
- Speed-walk for fast typing long directions

Install:

1) Open the package manager in mudlet (Alt+O) and add the package file for QC.
